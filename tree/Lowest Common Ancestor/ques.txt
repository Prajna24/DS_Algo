Lowest Common Ancestor

Write a program to find a common ancestor of a given two numbers in the tree. Let T 
be the root of a tree. The lowest common ancestor between two nodes n1 and n2 is 
defined as the lowest node in T. Which has both n1 and n2 as descendants (where we 
allow a node to be a descendant of itself). The LCA of n1 and n2 in T is the shared 
ancestor of n1 and n2, which is located farthest from the root. Computation of the 
Lowest common ancestor is useful. For instance, as part of a procedure for determining
 the distance between the pairs of a node in a tree. The distance from n1 to n2 can 
be computed as a distance from a root to n1. Plus, the distance from a root to n2. 
Later, subtract two times the distance from a root to their lowest common ancestor.
